											<h1 id="intro">Hi, I’m Sarah!</h1>
											<p>I often ask myself:<br> "What can I give to make a real, positive difference at where I am?"</p>
										</header>
										<p>Thanks for visiting my page. I am an aspiring software engineer with background in Post-Editing Machine Translation and bilingual open-source research. <br><br>Interestingly enough, translation and coding have a lot in common. You take one language and render that comprehensible to the other side of the world!<br><br> The art of 'translation' done through coding languages is especially powerful when we consider the clear trajectory of its results: Combined with good will, it creates real, tangible and positive changes in other people's lives. <br><br> I can't wait to join your efforts in realizing awesome ideas and touching other people's lives in a way that only software engineers can do! As an enthusiast of altruistic visions and a person of an inquisitive mind, I look forward to learning, growing, giveing back and testing how far we can go together.</p>

											<span class="image"> <img src="images/beach.jpg" alt="Family photo of Saraj, John and Daniel" /></span>
											<p>I live in North Bethesda, MD with my husband John and my three-year-old son Daniel. John works for a customs and border protection project as a software engineer. I thank him for inspiring me to explore the world of software engineering and making me laugh every day with his quirky sense of humor. Daniel is happy and mischievous little person. He is especially enthusiastice about all kinds pf starfish. </p>

											<p>I have 8 years of experience working as a Korean Linguist under my belt. The majority of my work, including research, translation, transcription, analysis, and quality control tasks, cater to the stringent requirements of the Federal Government client. Through the past experiences, I aquired hands-on oral and written communication skills that can effectively process complicated information and deliver it in a simpler manner for the clients and stakeholders. And can the 'complicated information' include codes as well? Yes, I believe so!</p>

											<p>Human Rights issue in North Korea has always been close to my heart. You may already be aware of what is going on in that small country in North East Asia, but <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2021-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/north-korea/">click here</a> if you are curious to learn more. <br><br>In my years as a graduate student at George Washington University, I had the previlage of assisting David Hawk, a former Executive Director of Amnesty International, USA, and a former UN human rights official of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, in working on a <a href="">report</a> on political prison camp in North Korea. It has been some time ago that the report was published, but I wanted to share one of my dearest none-code-based projects here.</p>

											<p>I have two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo">Taekwondo</a> black belts. I started Takwondo in my early twenties because I wanted to convince myself that I can do something that I never imagined myself doing.<br><br> I developed several lottery games that generated millions of dollars of revunue for the Washington DC Lottery. <br><br>As a child, my dream was to become an entomologist. My father, who've always encouraged my curiosity as I grew up, got a translated edition of "Souvenirs entomologiques" by Jean-Henri Fabre and the book quickly became my childhood favorite.</p>
