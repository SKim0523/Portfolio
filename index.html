											</div>
											<p>I often ask myself:<br> "What can I give to make a real, positive difference with where I am in life?"</p>
										</header>
										<p id="searchable-text">Thanks for visiting my page. I am an aspiring software engineer with a background in Post-Editing Machine Translation and bilingual open-source research. <br><br>Interestingly enough, translation and coding have a lot in common. You take one language and render that comprehensible to the other side of the world!<br><br>'Translation' done through coding languages bridges human minds and technologies. This is especially powerful when we consider the sheer potential of coding. Combined with good will, it creates real, tangible and positive changes in other people's lives. <br><br> As an enthusiast of altruistic visions and a person of an inquisitive mind, I can't wait to join your efforts in realizing awesome ideas and touching other people's lives in a way that only software engineers can do! I look forward to learning, growing and testing how far we can go together.</p>

											<span class="image" id="more"> <img src="images/beach.jpg" alt="Family photo of Saraj, John and Daniel" /></span>
											<p>I live in North Bethesda, MD with my husband John and my three-year-old son Daniel. John has been working on a government customs and border protection project as a software engineer for the last two years. I thank him for inspiring me to explore the world of software engineering and making me laugh every day with his quirky sense of humor. Daniel is a happy and mischievous little person. He is very enthusiastic about all kinds of sea animals (especially starfish) and plants. </p>

											<p>I have 8 years of experience working as a Korean Linguist under my belt. The majority of my work, including research, translation, transcription, analysis, and quality control tasks, has catered to the stringent requirements of Federal Government clients. Through these experiences, I acquired oral and written communication skills that can effectively process complicated information and deliver it in a simpler manner for the clients and stakeholders. Can the 'complicated information' include codes as well? Yes, I believe so!</p>

											<p>Human Rights issues, and especially that of North Korea, has always been close to my heart. You may already be aware of what is going on in that small country in North East Asia, but <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2021-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/north-korea/" target="_blank">click here</a> if you are curious to learn more on the human rights situation there. <br><br>In my years as a graduate student at George Washington University, I had the previlege of assisting David Hawk, a former Executive Director of Amnesty International, USA, and a former official of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, in publishing a <a href="https://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/HRNK_HiddenGulag2_Web_5-18.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> on political prison camp systems in North Korea. The report has been published some time ago now, but I wanted to share one of my dearest none-code-related projects here as well.</p>

											<p>I have two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo">Taekwondo</a> black belts. I started Takwondo in my early twenties because I wanted to overcome fears and convince myself that I can do anything if I put my mind to it.<br><br>I developed several lottery games that generated millions of dollars of revenue for the Washington DC Lottery. Some of them are still in the market contributing to the <a href="https://dclottery.com/where-money-goes#:~:text=Since%20the%20Lottery's%20inception%20in,to%20the%20District's%20General%20Fund." target="_blank">'General Fund'</a> of the DC government!<br><br>As a child, my dream was to become an entomologist. My father, who've always encouraged my curiosity as I grew up, got a translated edition of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Souvenirs-entomologiques-linstinct-moeurs-insectes/dp/2221054628" target="_blank">"Souvenirs entomologiques"</a> by Jean-Henri Fabre and the book quickly became my childhood favorite.</p>
